    """RGB version of the `EuroSAT <https://github.com/phelber/eurosat>`_ Dataset.

    For the MS version of the dataset, see
    `TorchGeo <https://torchgeo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/datasets.html#eurosat>`__.

    Args:
        root (str or ``pathlib.Path``): Root directory of dataset where ``root/eurosat`` exists.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in a PIL image or torch.Tensor, depends on the given loader,
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again. Default is False.
        loader (callable, optional): A function to load an image given its path.
            By default, it uses PIL as its image loader, but users could also pass in
            ``torchvision.io.decode_image`` for decoding image data into tensors directly.
